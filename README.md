# Multimodal-database
The DRECC database was developed using emergency and critical care patient data collected at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, since 2018.
By integrating with multiple in-hospital information systems and leveraging a master data management platform, the system achieves comprehensive integration of patient workflow data and multimodal data fusion.
Its layered and modular architecture systematically covers key components including medical visits, diagnoses, prescriptions, surgeries, clinical scores, diagnostic tests, vital signs, admission/discharge records, and follow-up care, providing high-quality, structured data support for scientific research in acute and critical care medicine.
